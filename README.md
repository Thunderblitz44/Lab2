#My project is in the lab2 releases, hopefully the .exe file works for you. My game is going to be a fast paced 3d platformer/shooter where the player is put in an obstacle course. The player will first have to reach the end of the obstacle course, riddled with enemies that stun the player and slow them down but is also filled will coins that give the player a brief speed bonus. Instead of a traditional shooter, in this game the player wont be able to die, instead if they are hit by anything they are stunned/slowed briefly. Once the player reaches the end of the level the map begins to collapse, the player will have to replay the level backwards except this time they must complete the level in a set amount of time and kill all of the enemies. Once a player kills all of the enemies and reaches the end, they win the game. If the player cant beat the level in time, they must repeat the level and is the only way to lose.
